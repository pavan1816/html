    <h2><i>Summary</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Pokémon</b>, (an acronym for <mark>Pocket Monsters</mark>[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.
        The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon".
        In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport.
        All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".
        There are currently 898 Pokémon species.

    <h2><i>Name</i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The name Pokémon is a syllabic abbreviation of the Japanese brand <mark>Pocket Monsters</mark>.[22] The term "Pokémon", 
        In addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 898 fictional species that have made appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the eighth generation titles Pokémon Sword and Shield. 
        "Pokémon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species name;
        It is and would be grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".

        <h2><i>Anime</i></h2>
        There have been 23 animated theatrical Pokémon films (latest film to be released on December 25, 2020[39]),
        which have been directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Tetsuo Yajima, and distributed in Japan by Toho since 1998. 
        The pair of films, Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram and White—Victini and Zekrom are considered together as one film. Collectibles, 
        such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films. 
        Since the 20th film, the films have been set in an alternate continuity separate from the anime series.
